# Changelog

## Known Issues
- Tested (almost) exclusively with `dnd5e` system -- other systems may encounter errors -- please report in Issue Log
- Initiative icon assumes `d20`-based initiative
- Some strings are still not setup for translation
- When multiple combatants are added to combat at the same time, and the `Control Active Combatant` setting is enabled, there will be an error in console. It doesn't appear to prevent any Carousel behaviour.
- Currently only the attribute set as the 1st Token bar is able to be set as the Carousel 1st bar (eg. if your Token config is set to `system.attributes.hp` then this is the only attribute Combat Carousel will work with for now)

> This update adds compatibility for Foundry VTT v10.290

- PF2e: the roll Initiative dialog setting is now respected (eg. dialog won't be shown if it is turned off)

> This update adds compatibility for Foundry VTT v10

## [0.2.3] - 2021-10-11
- Spanish translation updated (thanks @lozalojo ! 🎉)
- Added options for `Limited` Actor permission to settings that support permissions (thanks @SovietVVinter ! 🎉)
- Hovering combatant cards in the carousel hovers the token again 🛸
- Panning for gold is fun, but panning to the active combatant might not be for you, so there's now a setting for that!
- Clicking a combatant card now bubbles that click to the matching token, which provides better support for modules that override the native left click
- Added support for the  🐛`Bug Reporter` module!

## [0.2.2] - 2021-09-03
- The evil incantation causing **hidden combatants** to be revealed has been dispelled. GMs: rest easy knowing your secret invisible party-killing superbeast surprise is no longer spoiled. (thanks @JamzTheMan 🎉)
- For SOME REASON some systems don't use `attributes.hp` for health bars. Weird huh! Combat Carousel works with these systems again. 
- Combatants who don't make the cut can be **deleted** from the Carousel again. (Yikes Roger, you really screwed up that death save...)
- - ...also added a **confirmation dialog** in case you accidentally click the wrong combatant (like anyone except Roger...) 
- Sidebar hidden (eg. by some other module) but the **Carousel doesn't fill the space**? Now it does! (thanks @sPOIDar 🎉)
- **No combat**? No problem (any longer)! (thanks @DavidAremaCarretero 🎉)
- Apparently having every single Active Effect on the Combatant Card wasn't desirable in all situations (PF2e users I see you!). Well now you can **choose which Effects to show** (All, Temporary + Passive, Temporary Only, Passive Only) (thanks @Drental 🎉 for contributing code to this)
- In case you don't like to be in control, there's now a setting to control whether you **control the active Combatant** when it changes
- Updated **Spanish** translation (thanks @lozalojo 🎉)
- Updated **Japanese** translation (thanks `touge` and @brothersharper 🎉)
- Confirmed compatibility with Foundry VTT 0.8.9

## [0.2.1] - 2021-07-06
> This release marks the public beta for the 0.2.x series of Combat Carousel.
- Added compatibility for Foundry VTT v0.8.x
- You can now disable the module even if your GM was nice enough to install and enable it! Simply uncheck the `Enable Combat Carousel` setting to disable its functionality... you monster.
- Added `Combatant` option for **Combat Carousel** card images. This will use the image you've set for combatant--overriding their token image--but defaults to the token image if none exists.
- Carousel is no longer forcefully rendered during combat updates *except* when Combat Carousel is enabled and combat is created
- In case you have second thoughts you now get a prompt (same as core Foundry) when deleting a combat/encounter.
- **Combat Carousel** should be approximately 43.51629% more efficient due to more stringent checks when processing actor/token updates.
- Active/Status Effects are visible again. Yes Gary... for the last time, your character is still petrified!
